Of course along the way fixing bugs, increasing Lua support + libraries + documentation, and eventually, a creating a map editor.","At that point, you should be able to play Fernweh and get a close-to-finish experience. And once we're there, ideally, we should have a small community of people interested in development, and we should have a team ready to write, design, and create more campaigns/games for Fernweh.","This is quite a hopeful plan.
